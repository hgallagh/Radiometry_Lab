#This little grain is more reflective...we are looking at the spectra and
# stuff of this at different angles with the goniometer.

#To keep track of all of these files, I could just import them all and decide to separate them if necessary...


#Unfortunately, radiometry is difficult for large view zenith angles due to the
#resulting smaller projected sample areas, so these radiance measurements only extend
#to view zenith angles of θr = 70◦.

#This one would be the 63-300 micron meters aka mu m.

#There is the diffuse sphere one for the small grains
#Then i30 and i60 for this grain size with DN spectra and Radiance spectra

#That makes enough sense that we need to use what we did in part 1 if this is part 2, we are
#using an emperical way of doing things from our line graph thing with some slope ideas...
