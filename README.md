This is the readMe for the Radiometry Lab. This is the first attempt in Python, but of course that may change in the near future. 


Currently, I am focusing on the first part to perform a simplistic linear regression with the uncalibrated DN number readings and then the calibrated radiance readings from the Helios Sphere. 

PART 1:
They ask this of the lab staff to do this... 

Plot all the spectra as functions of the given wavelength
range and include these in your report. The 5 raw DNR spectra should be in their
own plot, and the 5 calibrated radiance spectra should be displayed in a separate
plot. Based on these plots, can you ascertain which DNR spectra likely correspond
to which radiance spectra? Why did we convert the DNs to DNRs?

For each wavelength in the VNIR, build a linear regression, so we can correlate
the measured DNRs to known radiance values; that is:
L(λ) = m(λ) DNR(λ) + b(λ) (11)
where m(λ) and b(λ) are the slopes and intercepts, respectively, as functions of wave-
length. Compute and plot m(λ) and b(λ) as functions of wavelength and include
these in your report. What are the units of m(λ) and b(λ)?


I am currently figuring out if I need to sample the plot or am I able to take every light level and then plot for each light level. I'm trying to remember currently.
