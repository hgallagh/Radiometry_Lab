This is the readMe for the Radiometry Lab. This is the first attempt in Python, but of course that may change in the near future. 


Currently, I am focusing on the first part to perform a simplistic linear regression with the uncalibrated DN number readings and then the calibrated radiance readings from the Helios Sphere.
